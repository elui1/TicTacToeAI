# TicTacToeAI
This is my implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe application using Python.
Games can be played in three modes: human vs human, human vs computer, and computer vs computer.
The computer AI comes in three levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
The Easy AI plays randomly, while the Hard AI plays optimally by employing the Minimax Algorithm.
