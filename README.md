# TicTacToeAI
This is my implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe application using Python.
Games can be played in three modes: human vs human, human vs computer, and computer vs computer.
The computer AI comes in three levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
The Easy AI plays randomly, while the Hard AI plays optimally by employing the Minimax Algorithm.

Gameplay: Input takes two commands, separated by a space, to assign the players to X and O respectively. Valid commands are "user" for human player, and "easy", "medium", "hard" for AI player. To make a move, enter a number from 0-8.
